**Difficulty: Very Easy**

_Description:_ The malware sample doesnâ€™t appear to print anything useful. But our threat intel team believes it holds a hardcoded configuration string. Can you pull on some strings to retrieve it? Note: This sample is not actual malware.

# Tool Used 
**strings:** A command-line tool used to find and display sequences of printable characters (strings of text) within binary files.

# Methodology 
1. Extract the Challenge File: I used the unzip command on hardcodedlies.zip to extract the main challenge file I downloaded, hardcodedlies.
2. Identify File Type: The file command confirmed hardcodedlies was a "Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable," indicating a compiled program for analysis.
3. Extract Strings to Find the Flag: Using the strings command on hardcodedlies, I extracted all readable text. Among these strings, I quickly located the flag embedded directly within the binary's data.


> **Flag:** C1{h4rdc0ded_but_0verlooked}
