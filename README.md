# DoD-Cyber-Sentinel-CTF-Challenge-June-2025

Over the weekend, I competed in my very first Capture The Flag (CTF) competition, the DoD Cyber Sentinel Skills Challenge, hosted by Correlation One and the U.S. Department of Defense. And let me tell you, it was a full-blown cybersecurity marathon!

For those new to the game, CTFs are dynamic cybersecurity competitions where participants race against the clock to solve a series of challenges across various domains like web exploitation, forensics, reverse engineering, cryptography, and more, all to snag those elusive "flags"—hidden strings that validate your solutions. Beyond the thrill of the chase, CTFs are incredible: they offer a hands-on learning playground, sharpen your problem-solving skills, and expose you to a vast array of cybersecurity concepts and tools. Plus, they're fantastic for networking and showcasing your practical prowess to potential employers!

I had the distinct privilege of participating in this individual-based CTF event on June 14th, which ran for a solid eight hours, from 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM Eastern Time. The competition threw a diverse set of challenges my way, spanning Forensics, Malware/Reverse Engineering, Networking & Reconnaissance, Open-Source Intelligence Gathering (OSINT), and Web Security. The difficulty levels ranged from "Very Easy" to "Hard", and every flag followed a consistent format: C1{th1s_1s_4_f14g}.

This challenge was remarkably well-orchestrated, with engaging scenarios and a fantastic dose of humor woven throughout. Facing 22 unique challenges, I leveraged a variety of powerful tools, many readily available in Kali Linux, to navigate the complexities. The organizers were great, even providing a recommended tools list, which included essentials like Burp Suite, Wireshark, Nmap, and various forensic and reverse engineering utilities. The best part? We were free to use any tools we desired —and yes, even ChatGPT or other large language model (LLM) tools were fair game!

My journey through the CTF was a rollercoaster of discovery and intense focus. I started strong but hit a significant roadblock aat round 950 points with three hours remaining. Cryptography challenges, in particular, proved to be deep rabbit holes! The scoring system allowed for strategic use of hints with point deductions. I leaned into this, spending about 500 points on hints to power through the remaining challenges and climb the leaderboard. Each difficulty level had a set point value, with "Very Easy" challenges at 75 points (no hint deduction), "Easy" at 150 points (-25 per hint), "Medium" at 200 points (-50 per hint), and "Hard" at 300 points (-75 per hint).


Ultimately, I conquered 20 out of the 22 challenges, racking up a final score of 2,175 points. This landed me an impressive 26th place out of a massive 2,149 competitors! Honestly, for my first CTF, placing within the top 2% globally feels pretty fantastic.

This competition was an exceptional "pressure test" of my skills across web security, encryption analysis, threat hunting, and memory dump analysis. It provided a direct, hands-on opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, perfectly mirroring the types of challenges faced by the DoD. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have been selected for this amazing challenge by Correlation One and the U.S. Department of Defense. It wasn't just about the competition; it was about connecting with sharp minds in the field and exploring exciting career pathways in national-level missions. I'm already buzzing with excitement to continue learning and eagerly anticipate the next challenge!
